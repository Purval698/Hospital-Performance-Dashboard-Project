# Hospital-Performance-Dashboard-Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing hospital patient data to gain insights into patient admissions, diagnoses, bed occupancy, billing, 
and healthcare operations. Using Power BI, interactive dashboards were created to visualize key metrics and trends,
enabling healthcare administrators to make data-driven decisions.

## Objectives
- Analyze patient admission and discharge trends over time.
- Examine billing and health insurance data to understand financial performance.
- Provide actionable insights to improve hospital operations and patient care.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **Patient_ID**: Unique identifier for each patient.
- **Admit_Date**: Date of patient admission.
- **Discharge_Date**: Date of patient discharge.
- **Diagnosis**: Medical diagnosis of the patient.
- **Bed_Occupancy**: Bed occupancy status (Yes/No).
- **Test**: Medical tests conducted for the patient.
- **Doctor**: Attending doctor for the patient.
- **Followup Date**: Date for patient follow-up.
- **Feedback**: Patient feedback (e.g., Satisfied, Neutral, Dissatisfied).
- **Billing Amount**: Total billing amount for the patient.
- **Health Insurance Amount**: Amount covered by health insurance.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
   - Standardized date formats and categorized categorical variables.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Analyzed trends in patient admissions and discharges over time.
   - Calculated bed occupancy rates and resource utilization metrics.
   - Examined billing and health insurance data to understand financial performance.

3. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Created interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize key metrics.
   - Included visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and tables.
   - Added filters for dynamic data exploration (e.g., by diagnosis, doctor, or time period).

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel**: For data cleaning and preprocessing.

## Key Insights
1. **Admission Trends**:
   - Peak admission periods were identified, helping in resource allocation.
   - Certain diagnoses (e.g., respiratory issues) showed seasonal trends.

2. **Financial Performance**:
   - Billing and health insurance data revealed insights into revenue streams.
   - Opportunities for improving billing processes were identified.

3. **Patient Feedback**:
   - Patient feedback was analyzed to identify areas for improvement in patient care.
   - Dissatisfaction rates were linked to specific diagnoses or doctors.

## Files
- `Hospitals_Performance_Visualization.pbix`: Power BI file containing the interactive dashboards.
- `screenshotofDashboard`: File containing screenshots of the Power BI dashboards.

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. Download the `Hospital_Dashboard.pbix` file.
2. Open the file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Use the interactive filters to explore the data:
   - Filter by diagnosis, doctor, or time period.
   - Drill down into specific metrics (e.g., bed occupancy, billing amounts).
